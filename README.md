# individual Project and Final Project
Individual Project Outline:
This project is a tutorial in how to webscrape data sets from the internet using python. For this specific project, I will be webscraping the following data sets: 
    1. A data set on the number of guns per capita for various countries around the world.
    2. The homocide rate per country around the world.
    3. Nominal GDP per country around the world.
 
After this data sets have been imported to python, I will clean the three data sets and merge them into one data set. I will then perform some EDA on this dataset to gain some insights on the relationship between the number or guns per capita of a nation and it's murder rate per 100,000 people.
